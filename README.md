# A Compiler for Wabbit

This is a compiler for the Wabbit language. It is written in python and will compile to LLVM instructions. 
The code for each part of the compiler is in the python modules located at the `src` folder.

Currently, the compiler itself is incomplete. You can run each module separately with the test modules. In the future, you will be able to use the complete compiler module to create executable code.
